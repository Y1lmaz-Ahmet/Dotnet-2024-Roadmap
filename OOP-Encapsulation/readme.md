# Key Aspects of Encapsulation

## 1. Data Hiding:
	- **What:** Encapsulation hides the **internal** state (fields) of a class **from external** entities
	- **Why:** Prevents direct manipulation of internal data, reducing the risk of unintended changes and enforcing controlled acces.

## 2. Controlled Access:
	- **What:** Acces to the internal state is regulated through well-defined interfaces (properties and methods)
	- **Why:** Provides a clear and controlled way of external entities to interact with the class, **preventing unauthorized acces**

## 3. Code Organization:
	- **What:** Grouping related data and methods within a class.
	- **Why:** Improves code organization, making it **more modular** and **easier to understand**.
