# Key Aspects of Encapsulation

## 1. Data Hiding:
- **What**: Encapsulation hides the **internal** state (fields) of a class **from external** entities.
- **Why**: Prevents direct manipulation of internal data, reducing the risk of unintended changes and enforcing controlled acces.

## 2. Controlled Access:
- **What**: Acces to the internal state is regulated through well-defined interfaces (properties and methods)
- **Why**: Provides a clear and controlled way of external entities to interact with the class, **preventing unauthorized acces**

## 3. Code Organization:
- **What**: Grouping related data and methods within a class.
- **Why**: Improves code organization, making it **more modular** and **easier to understand**.

# Pros and Cons of Encapsulation

## Pros:

### 1. Data Integrity:
- **Pro:** Prevents accidental modification of internal data, maintaining data integrity.

### 2. Code maintenance:
- **Pro:** Facilitates easier code maintenance by isolating changes withing the class.

### 3. Security:
- **Pro:** Enhances security by restricting direct acces to internal implementation details.

### 4. Abstraction:
- **Pro:** Encapsulation allow for **abstraction**, focusing on `what` **the class does rather than `how` it does** it!!
